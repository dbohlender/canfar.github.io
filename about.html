	<h1>About CANFAR</h1>
	
	<p> 
	  The Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research (CANFAR)
	  is a computing infrastructure for astronomers. CANFAR aims to
	  provide to its users easy access to very large resources for both
	  storage and processing, using a cloud based framework. CANFAR allows
	  astronomers to run processing jobs on a set of computing clusters,
	  and to store data at a set of data centres.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Imagine you have a processing intensive analysis that must be run on
	  imaging data as observations are acquired, but once the processing
	  is completed your computing needs decrease. The CANFAR system allows
	  you to create a computing environment (a Virtual Machine) that
	  will be deployed on a computer clusters. The number of instances of your
	  VM that will be started grows to meet your current need. When the
	  computing is done, the VMs are shutdown and the computing resources
	  are freed for other users. The VM approach ensures that the software
	  you want to run is consistent regardless of the grid or cluster
	  installation where your analysis is conducted.
