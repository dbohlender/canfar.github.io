    The Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research (CANFAR)
    is a computing infrastructure for astronomers. CANFAR aims to
    provide to its users easy access to very large resources for both
    storage and processing, using a cloud based framework. CANFAR allows
    astronomers to run processing jobs on a set of computing clusters,
    and to store data at a set of data centres.

    Imagine you have a processing intensive analysis that must be run on
    imaging data as observations are acquired, but once the processing
    is completed, your computing needs decrease. The CANFAR system allows
    you to create a computing environment (a Virtual Machine) that
    will be deployed on a computer clusters. The number of instances of your
    VM that will be started grows to meet your current need. When the
    computing is done, the VMs are shutdown and the computing resources
    are freed for other users. The VM approach ensures that the software
    you want to run is consistent regardless of the grid or cluster
    installation where your analysis is conducted.
