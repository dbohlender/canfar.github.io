	<h1>VM Access</h1>

	Access to the canfar hosts is limited to SSH (Secure Shell).  
	SSH is a key-based authentication mechanism.  This requires set up on
	both your local machine, and any remote machines where you need either
	interactive or programmatic connections. SSH has a client-server
	architecture.

	<h2>SSH Desktop Setup</h2>
	<h3>Basic SSH configuration</h3>
	On the canfar login host, you have probably created your ssh key with
	either the <code>canfarsetup</code> command or with
	a <code>ssh-keygen</code> command.
	For easy access and for the VNC connections to work, you will need to
	copy the private key to your desktop.
	<pre><code>
	    scp USER@canfar.dao.nrc.ca:.ssh/id*sa* ~/.ssh/           #
	    be careful you might overwrite your existing keys
	    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id*sa
	</code></pre>

	You actually don't need the private key on the canfar login host, this
	is slightly insecure but more convenient to have. However the CANFAR
	VMOD system needs the public key.
	Now to simplify your connections to CANFAR VM and login host, you can
	add the following lines to your desktop/laptop .ssh/config file:

	<pre><code>
	    Host canfar
	    Hostname canfar.dao.nrc.ca
	    User USER

	    Host 172.22.128.*
	    User USER
	    ProxyCommand ssh canfar -W %h:%p
	</code></pre>

	With these commands, you can connect to the canfar login host simply
	with <code>ssh canfar</code> command, and connect directly to the VM
	with <code>ssh <VM IP></code> command.

	<h3>Advanced SSH configuration</h3>
	For a more advanced setup, you can add these options to
	your <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. Add them to either each "Host"
	individually, or defining a "Host *" section that will apply for all:
	<ul>
	  <li>allow X windows launched from your VM to appear:</li>
	  <pre><code>
	      ForwardX11 yes
	      ForwardX11Trusted yes
	  </code></pre>
	  <li> use agent forwarding to avoid typing passphrases all the time</li>
	  <pre><code>
	      ForwardAgent yes
	  </code></pre>
	  <li>re-use existing ssh connections</li>:
	  <pre><code>
	      ControlMaster auto
	      ControlPath ~/.ssh/control/%h-%l-%p
	      ControlPersist 3600
	  </code></pre>
	  and create your directory for the sessions:
	  <pre><code>
	      mkdir ~/.ssh/control
	  </code></pre>
	  <li>If you need to have several private keys add</li>
	  <pre><code>
	      IdentityFile /full/path/to/my/private/key
	  </code></pre>
	  <li>If you are often losing connections, you could add</li>
	  <pre><code>
	      ServerAliveInterval 30
	  </code></pre>
	</ul>

	<h2>Command-line connection to the VMs (interactive and batch)</h2>
	You can access the CANFAR configuration VM by simply follow the basic
	setup above, and from your desktop:
	<pre>
	  ssh VM_IP
	</pre>
	Or without any desktop setup; connecting to the canfar login host,
	then the VM:
	<pre><code>
	    ssh USER@canfar.dao.nrc.ca    # enter CADC password
	    ssh VM_IP                     # enter passphrase that you generated
	</code></pre>

	If you want to connect to a running job that you launched with condor,
	for a sufficiently recent VM, you can directly connect your VM
	wherever it is running from the canfar login host:
	<pre><code>
	    condor_ssh_to_job JOB_ID
	</code></pre>

	<h2>Graphical (VNC) connection to the interactive VMs</h2>

	<h3>Using the CANFAR web interface</h3>
	You can access the CANFAR configuration VM using only your browser
	using the Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocol. The CANFAR web
	interface offers a VNC client. You will need to use the same ssh keys
	on your desktop and on the canfar login host. 

	Follow these steps to use the CANFAR web interface VNC client.

	<ol>
	  <li> Go to your <a href="http://www.canfar.phys.uvic.ca/processing/#html/_vm_list.html">Running VMs page</a></li>
	  <li> Click on the link of the IP address. </li>
	  <li> Depending on your browser and operating system, you will be offered to open a Java Web Start application, or to  download a file called VNCSession.jnlp. </li>
	  <li> If it already offers you to open it, skip this step. Otherwise, you can open the downloaded file with a Java Web Start program. On some Linux systems, the executable is often called <code>javaws</code>. You might want to configure your browser to do it automatically. Many configurations are possible, please search the internet for a solution for your specific browser and OS, looking "java web start" key words for example. </li>
	  <li> Now click to run the application. You might have to accept a certificate which you need to accept. </li>
	  <li> You should be asked for "Your private key authentication". This unclear message is the ssh passphrase you entered on the canfar login host. Then accept the standard ssh unknown host message "Are you sure you want to continue connecting" by clicking "yes"</li>
	  <li> Then you will be asked a "VNC authentication password": either
	    choose one if it is the first time on this session, or enter the same
	    one as you entered initially for this session.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Other possible VNC connections</h3>
	You might have a more pleasant experience using other VNC clients,
	such as more native to your operating system. One way to do it is to
	use ssh tunnelling.
	<ul>
	  <li>For the ssh server, set canfar.dao.nrc.ca, with your CADC user name</li>
	  <li>For the VNC server set to VM_IP:5901</li>
	  <li>You will need to start the VNC server on your VM, by either using
	    the CANFAR web VNC graphical client mentioned above, or running this
	    command:
	    <pre>
	      ssh VM_IP vncserver
	    </pre>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	Now you need a VNC client on your desktop. Here are some examples of
	known to be good VNC clients for Linux and OSX:

	<h4>Linux</h4>
	<ul>
	  <li> Install Remmina, then launch it</li>
	  <li> From Reminna, click "Create a new profile" with:
	    <pre>
	      Basic - Server: VM_IP:5901
	      Basic - Username: USER
	      SSH - Enable SSH tunnel: yes
	      SSH - SSH Server - Custom - Server: canfar.dao.nrc.ca
	      SSH - SSH Authentification - Public Key(automatic): yes
	    </pre>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Mac OS-X</h4>
	<ol>
	  <li> create an ssh tunnel (assumes the ssh configuration above):
	    <pre><code>
		ssh -f -N -L 5902:VM_IP:5901 canfar
	  </code></pre></li>
	  <li>Launch safari and point your it to: <a href="vnc://localhost:5902">vnc://localhost:5902</a></li>
	  <li>Once you're done, kill your ssh tunnel (find the process id, then kill)</li>
