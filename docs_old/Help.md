The CANFAR system is maintained by the [CADC](http://www.cadc.hia.nrc.gc.ca).

This wiki provides information for users of CANFAR and is editable by all CANFAR users.

If you are interested in getting a CANFAR computing account or a VOSpace account (or both) follow these instructions:

1.  [Request a CADC account](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/auth/register.html) (if you don't already have one).
2.  [Email the CANFAR Help Desk](mailto:canfarhelp@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca) explaining your CANFAR computing and VOSpace requirements, providing your CADC user name and a very brief justification (1 or 2 sentences). If we need more information we will contact you).
3.  Once you get a e-mail back saying that your VOSpace / CANFAR login has been created you are ready to go, follow the instructions in on the <Introduction> page.

Chat Room
---------

You can have direct collaborative support by meeting CANFAR users and developers in a chat room. This is probably the most efficient way to get help quickly. You need to:

1.  have a XMPP/Jabber account (jabber.org, gmail, facebook...). If you do not want to use your private account, creating a new one at [jabber.org](https://register.jabber.org/) is quick.
2.  have a client supporting the XMPP protocol A list of clients is available on the [XMPP web site](http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/). If you don't know which one to choose, here are the ones what most people use:
    -   Linux: pidgin, empathy or kopete (usually already installed)
    -   Mac OSX: adium, iChat [File-\>Go to Chat Room and then enter 'canfar@conference.jabber.org' as the chat room name].
    -   Windows: pidgin, Google talk

3.  join the chat room with the following settings:
    -   Room: canfar
    -   Server: conference.jabber.org
