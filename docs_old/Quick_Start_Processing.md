This is the Quick Start guide to processing and submitting jobs. If you need more details, go to the [In Depth Processing](In Depth Processing "wikilink") documentation.

Getting a processing account
----------------------------

If you haven't got one already, get a CANFAR processing account:

1.  You will need a CADC account which you can request at [<http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/auth/register.html>](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/auth/register.html).
2.  Then send an email to the [CANFAR Help Desk](mailto:canfarhelp@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca) with a couple of lines describing your processing (you might have done it with your VOSpace request already).
3.  Once you get a e-mail back saying that your account has been setup, go to: [<http://www.canfar.phys.uvic.ca/processing>](http://www.canfar.phys.uvic.ca/processing) to make sure you can login.

Using the Jobs Submission system
--------------------------------

1.  You should have a Virtual Machine ready. If not, follow the <VMCreation> guide.
2.  Click on the "Submit Jobs" tab to send your request
3.  Monitor jobs in the queue with the "Running Jobs" tab.
4.  You can script job submissions, job listing and job removals using the CANFAR processing web service. Please refer to the guide located at [<http://www.canfar.phys.uvic.ca/proc/>](http://www.canfar.phys.uvic.ca/proc/).
