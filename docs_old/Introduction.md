Are you an astronomer and would like to perform reproducible research? With the Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research infrastructure you can build your data processing pipeline, interactively analyze results, and launch thousands of batch jobs on multiple clusters, using exactly the same operating system and software stack. It is especially well suited for data intensive astronomy, but the system is generic enough so that it could be used in many cases outside astronomy.
