A Virtual Machine is a computer system running inside another computing system. The primary (or real) computing system provides the link to the hardware on which the computation is being done and provides an environment in which the 'Virtual Machine' can be created. This extra level of abstraction comes with a small performance price which is easily overcome by considering the savings in development costs. Once your computation works in your VM you can be certain that the computation will work on the computers that your processing will execute on.
