The CANFAR system is maintained by the [CADC](http://www.cadc.hia.nrc.gc.ca).

If you are interested in getting a CANFAR computing account or a VOSpace account (or both) follow these instructions:

1. [Request a CADC account](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/auth/register.html),
   if you don't already have one.
2. [File a new account issue](mailto:canfar@uvic.ca)
   explaining your computing and storage requirements,
   providing your CADC user name and a very brief justification (1 or
   2 sentences). If we need more information we will contact you.

## Chat Room

You can have direct collaborative support by meeting CANFAR users and
developers in a chat room. This is probably the most efficient way to
get help quickly. You need to:

1. have a XMPP/Jabber account (jabber.org, gmail, facebook...). If
   you do not want to use your private account, creating a new one at
   [jabber.org](https://register.jabber.org/) is quick. 
2. have a client supporting the XMPP protocol A list of clients is
   available on the
   [XMPP web site](http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/). If you
   don't know which one to choose, here are the ones what most people
   use: 
	- Linux: pidgin, empathy or kopete (usually already installed)
    - Mac OSX: adium, iChat [File-\>Go to Chat Room and then enter 'canfar@conference.jabber.org' as the chat room name].
    - Windows: pidgin, Google talk

3. join the chat room with the following settings:
	- Room: canfar
    - Server: conference.jabber.org
