1. Request a [CADC account](http://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/auth/register.html)
2. Send an e-mail to [CANFAR](mailto:canfar@uvic.ca) with your space and / or your computing requirements, your CADC user name and a very 2 lines justification. Please be realistic in your space requirements, if you later find that you need your quota increased, this can be done fairly easily.
