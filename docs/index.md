This documentation aims to help you using the CANFAR services. Most of the documentation is static and should be rarely updated. Browse with the right side margin to the page you would like to know about.

We also keep the documentation from the old Wiki site, converted to [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/canfar/canfar.github.io/tree/master/docs_old).
